Given a string B, find if it is possible to re-order the characters of the string B so that it can be represented as a concatenation of A similar strings.
Eg: B = aabb and A = 2, then it is possible to re-arrange the string as "abab" which is a concatenation of 2 similar strings "ab".
If it is possible, return 1, else return -1.
Example Input
Input 1:
 A = 2
 B = "bbaabb"
Input 2:
 A = 2
 B = "bc"

Example Output
Output 1:
 1
Output 2:
 -1
 
 
Return an integer denoting the maximum possible length of substring without repeating characters.
Example Input
Input 1:
 A = "abcabcbb"
Input 2:
 A = "AaaA"

Example Output
Output 1:
 3
Output 2:
 2
