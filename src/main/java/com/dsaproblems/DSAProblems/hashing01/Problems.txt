Given an array elements, check if there is a subarray with sum = 0
input-> 2, 2, 1, -3, 4, 3, 1, -2, -3, ans->yes
1 <= |A| <= 100000
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Given an unsorted integer array A of size N.
Find the length of the longest set of consecutive elements from array A.
input->A = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], output->4

Given an array A of N integers.
Find the largest continuous sequence in a array which sums to zero.
Example Input
A = [1,2,-2,4,-4]
Example Output
[2,-2,4,-4]
1 <= N <= 106
-107 <= A[i] <= 107
NOTE : If there are multiple correct answers, return the sequence which occurs first in the array.

You are given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ,..., AN and an integer B. Return the of count of distinct numbers in all windows of size B.
Formally, return an array of size N-B+1 where i'th element in this array contains number of distinct elements in sequence Ai, Ai+1 ,..., Ai+B-1.
Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3]
 B = 3
Input 2:
 A = [1, 1, 2, 2]
 B = 1
Example Output
Output 1:
 [2, 3, 3, 2]
Output 2:
 [1, 1, 1, 1]
 
 
We call a pair of distinct indices in that array a special if elements at those indices in the array are equal.
Find a special pair such that the distance between that pair is minimum. Distance between two indices is defined as |i-j|. 
If there is no special pair in the array, then return -1.
Return one integer corresponding to the minimum possible distance between a special pair.
1 <= |A| <= 10^5
Example Input
Input 1:
A = [7, 1, 3, 4, 1, 7]
Input 2:
A = [1, 1]
Example Output
Output 1:
 3
Output 2:
 1
